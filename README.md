Reflections:

I am still learning so i am sure there are a lot i can do beter, however this is where i am at now in my learning.  I am happy to build functional code.

I find this all a bit challenging, especially at first, however , it does get easier as I get more familiar with the process and the expectation of errors that come along with the work.

I am sure there is a lot i would develope to this application as i get mpore familiar with the code and the capabilities that come along with know the code better.

. keep practing .
